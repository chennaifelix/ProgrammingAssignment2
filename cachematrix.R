## This file provides utility to cache a matrix inverse
## MakeCacheMatrix is used as a getter setter for the matrix and matrix inversions
## cacheSolve identifies if a matrix inverse is already available and caculates if not present

## This function returns a list of setter and getter methods of a matrix and its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
